<h2 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:19">Project: Library</h2>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:247">This is a simple web application that allows users to add books to a virtual library. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a basic interface for managing a list of books with their titles, authors, number of pages, and reading status.</p>
<h3 data-sourcepos="5:1-5:12">Features</h3>
<ul data-sourcepos="7:1-10:0">
<li data-sourcepos="7:1-7:107"><strong>Add books:</strong> Users can input the title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read the book.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="8:1-8:81"><strong>Display books:</strong> The application displays the added books in a list format.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-10:0"><strong>Responsive design:</strong> The layout adapts to different screen sizes.</li>

<h3 data-sourcepos="18:1-18:17">Code overview</h3>
<ul data-sourcepos="20:1-23:0">
<li data-sourcepos="20:1-20:153"><strong>HTML (<code>index.html</code>):</strong> Sets up the basic structure of the page, including the form for adding books and the container for displaying the book list.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="21:1-21:88"><strong>CSS (<code>output.css</code>):</strong> Styles the elements, providing a clean and organized layout.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="22:1-23:0"><strong>JavaScript (<code>script.js</code>):</strong> Handles the logic for adding books to an array, displaying them on the page, and clearing the form after submission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-sourcepos="24:1-24:26">Potential improvements</h3>
<ul data-sourcepos="26:1-30:0">
<li data-sourcepos="26:1-26:170"><strong>Data persistence:</strong> Currently, the book data is not stored permanently. Implementing local storage or a database would allow the library to persist across sessions.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="27:1-27:117"><strong>Edit and delete books:</strong> Adding functionalities to edit or delete existing books would enhance user experience.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="28:1-28:113"><strong>Search and filter:</strong> Implementing search and filter options would make it easier to manage a large library.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="29:1-30:0"><strong>Improved styling:</strong> Enhancing the visual appeal with more advanced CSS techniques or a CSS framework could make the application more engaging.</li>
</ul>
